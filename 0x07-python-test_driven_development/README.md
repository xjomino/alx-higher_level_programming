0x07. Python - Test-driven development
Background Context
Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
Starting from today:

Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases

General
Why Python programming is awesome
What’s an interactive test
Why tests are important
How to write Docstrings to create tests
How to write documentation for each module and function
What are the basic option flags to create tests
How to find edge cases
